Subject: [PATCH] hid2hci: change subsystem in udev rule from usb to usb*

With kernel 3.6 (commit 7e97243c2080ecae7129e83635227fdebd4feef6) the
class for some devices (e.g. dongles from Logitech) were changed from
usb to usbmisc. As consequence the udev rule for hid2hci didn't work
anymore with kernels >= 3.6.

Changing the subsystem from "usb" to "usb*" matches both "usb" and
"usbmisc" and works with all kernels.
