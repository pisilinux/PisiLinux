.SH DESCRIPTION
0 A.D. (pronounced "zero ey-dee") is a free, open-source, cross-platform
real-time strategy (RTS) game of ancient warfare. In short, it is a
historically-based war/economy game that allows players to relive or rewrite
the history of Western civilizations, focusing on the years between 500 B.C.
and 500 A.D. The project is highly ambitious, involving state-of-the-art 3D
graphics, detailed artwork, sound, and a flexible and powerful custom-built
game engine.

The game has been in development by Wildfire Games (WFG), a group of volunteer,
hobbyist game developers, since 2001.
.PP
Basic gameplay:
.TP
\fB\-autostart\fR
load a map instead of showing main menu (see below)
.TP
\fB\-editor\fR
launch the Atlas scenario editor
.TP
\fB\-mod\fR \fINAME\fR
start the game using \fINAME\fR mod
.TP
\fB\-quickstart\fR
load faster (disables audio and some system info logging)

.PP
Autostart:
.TP
\fB\-autostart\fR=\fINAME\fR
map \fINAME\fR for scenario, or rms name for random map
.TP
\fB\-autostart-ai\fR=\fIPLAYER\fR:\fIAI\fR
adds named \fIAI\fR to the given \fIPLAYER\fR (e.g. 2:testbot)
.TP
\fB-autostart-aidiff\fR=\fIPLAYER\fR:\fIlevel\fR
changes the difficulty setting for \fIAI PLAYER\fR (0: easy, 3: very hard)

.PP
Multiplayer:
.TP
\fB\-autostart-playername\fR=\fINAME\fR
multiplayer local player \fINAME\fR (default 'anonymous')
.TP
\fB\-autostart-host\fR
multiplayer host mode
.TP
\fB\-autostart-players\fR=\fINUMBER\fR
multiplayer host: \fINUMBER\fR of client players (default 2)
.TP
\fB\-autostart-client\fR
multiplayer client mode
.TP
\fB\-autostart-ip\fR=\fIIP\fR
multiplayer client: connect to this host \fIIP\fR

.PP
Random maps only:
.TP
\fB\-autostart-random\fR
random map
.TP
\fB\-autostart-random\fR=\fISEED\fR
random map with \fISEED\fR value (default 0, use -1 for random)
.TP
\fB\-autostart-size\fR=\fITILES\fR
random map \fISIZE\fR in tiles (default 192)
.TP
\fB\-autostart-players\fR=\fINUMBER\fI
\fINUMBER\fR of players on random map
.TP
\fB-autostart-civ\fR=\fIPLAYER\fR:\fICIV\fR
changes the civilisation of player \fIPLAYER\fR to \fICIV\fR (default athen)

.PP
Configuration:
.TP
\fB\-conf\fR:\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR
set a config value (overrides the contents of system.cfg)
.TP
\fB\-g\fR=\fIF\fR
set the gamma correction to '\fIF\fR' (default 1.0)
.TP
\fB\-nosound\fR
disable audio
.TP
\fB-noUserMod\fR
disable loading of the user mod
.TP
\fB\-shadows\fR
enable shadows
.TP
\fB\-vsync\fR
enable VSync, i.e. lock FPS to monitor refresh rate
.TP
\fB\-xres\fR=\fIN\fR
set screen \fIX\fR resolution to '\fIN\fR'
.TP
\fB\-yres\fR=\fIN\fR
set screen \fIY\fR resolution to '\fIN\fR'

.PP
Advanced / diagnostic:
.TP
\fB\-dumpSchema\fR
creates a file \fIentity.rng\fR in the working directory, containing
complete entity XML schema, used by various analysis tools
.TP
\fB\-entgraph\fR
(disabled)
.TP
\fB\-listfiles\fR
(disabled)
.TP
\fB\-profile\fR=\fINAME\fR
(disabled)
.TP
\fB\-replay\fR=\fIPATH\fR
non-visual replay of a previous game, used for analysis purposes
\fIPATH\fR is system path to commands.txt containing simulation log
.TP
\fB\-writableRoot\fR
store runtime game data in root data directory
(only use if you have write permissions on that directory)
.TP
\fB\-ooslog\fR
dumps simulation state in binary and ASCII representations each turn,
files created in sim_log within the game's log folder. \fBNOTE\fR: game will
run much slower with this option!
.TP
\fB-serializationtest\fR
checks simulation state each turn for serialization errors; on test
failure, error is displayed and logs created in oos_log within the
game's log folder. \fBNOTE\fR: game will run much slower with this option!

.PP
Archive builder:
.TP
\fB\-archivebuild\fR=\fIPATH\fR
system \fIPATH\fR of the base directory containing mod data to be archived/precached
.TP
\fB\-archivebuild-output\fR=\fIPATH\fR
system \fIPATH\fR to output of the resulting .zip archive (use with archivebuild)
.TP
\fB\-archivebuild-compress\fR
enable deflate compression in the .zip
(no zip compression by default since it hurts compression of release packages)
