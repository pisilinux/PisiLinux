Description: Fix another small batch of broken test cases
 * ext/standard/tests/php_ini_loaded_file.phpt: this test only works if
   you call run-tests directly, but the included Makefile invokes the
   test in such a way that it fails (it explicitly loads an ini file,
   and the test assumes that none are loaded).  since it therefore seems
   like a somewhat useless test it has been removed.
 * cli/tests/006.phpt: $subject is <required> according to the docs for
   the two pcre functions that report it as such, so the expected string has
   been updated to match the output.
 * php.orig/ext/posix/tests/posix_errno_variation2.phpt: SIGKILL is not
   a defined constant unless the pcntl extension is loaded.  As was
   done elsewhere (posix_kill_basic.phpt, which oddly seems to do the
   same *incredibly sketchy* test that's done here), it's passed as a
   variable hardcoded to 9 instead.  Did i mention that this test is
   sketchy?
