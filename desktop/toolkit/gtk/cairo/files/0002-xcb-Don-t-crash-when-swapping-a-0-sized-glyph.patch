Subject: [PATCH 2/2] xcb: Don't crash when swapping a 0-sized glyph

malloc(0) needn't return NULL, and on glibc, doesn't.  Then we encounter
a loop of the form do { ... } while (--c), which doesn't do quite what
you were hoping for when c is initially 0.

Since there's nothing to swap in this case, just bomb out.
